## General Architecture: Roles & Permissions
The architecture is built on three core concepts:

Users: These are the individual accounts (e.g., the owner, the restaurant manager, the accountant).

Roles: These are "job titles" you can create (e.g., "Super Admin," "Restaurant Manager," "HR Manager"). A role is simply a collection of permissions.

Permissions: These are the specific actions a user can perform in the system (e.g., "view all employees," "edit payroll," "add new employee").

How it works: Instead of assigning permissions directly to each user, you assign a Role to a user. This makes management much easier. If you need to change what a "Restaurant Manager" can do, you edit the role once, and the change applies to all users with that role.

## Default Role Definitions
Here are the roles you can start with in the system, each with its own set of permissions.

1. Super Admin (System Owner)
This is the highest-level role with full control over everything. There are typically only one or two Super Admin accounts.

Permissions:

✅ User Management: Can create, edit, and delete all users, including other admins.

✅ Role Management: Can create new roles and define/modify the permissions for each role.

✅ Full Data View: Can see all employee data, reports, pulse logs, and payrolls.

✅ System Settings: Can change critical settings like the geofence radius, hourly pay rate, and system integrations.

✅ Final Approval: Can approve payroll and financial reports.

2. Restaurant Manager
This role is for the on-site manager who handles daily operations and staff.

Permissions:

✅ Employee Management: Can add new employees and edit their profile information.

✅ Live Monitoring: Can access the dashboard to see which employees are currently checked in.

✅ View Reports: Can view the pulse logs and work-hour reports for all employees.

❌ Financial Access: Cannot see or edit payroll information or pay rates.

❌ Admin Management: Cannot create or modify other admin users or their roles.

3. HR/Payroll Manager
This role is focused on the financial and human resources aspects, such as an accountant.

Permissions:

✅ Payroll Access: Can access the payroll module to calculate and process employee salaries.

✅ Export Reports: Can generate and export detailed financial and payroll reports.

✅ View Hours: Can see the total worked hours for each employee for calculation purposes.

❌ Live Monitoring: Does not have access to the live monitoring dashboard.

❌ Employee Management: Cannot add or edit employee profiles.

## How the Super Admin Manages Permissions
The Super Admin's interface should have a dedicated section called "Access Management" or "Roles & Permissions".

Workflow for assigning a new admin:

Create User: The Super Admin creates a new user account with an email and a temporary password.

Assign Role: On the user creation screen, there will be a dropdown menu labeled "Role." The Super Admin selects the appropriate role (e.g., "Restaurant Manager").

Save: Once saved, the new user automatically inherits all the permissions associated with that role.

Workflow for creating a new role (e.g., "Shift Supervisor"):

The Super Admin goes to the "Roles & Permissions" section and clicks "Create New Role."

They name the role "Shift Supervisor."

A checklist of every possible permission in the system appears.

The Super Admin selects only the necessary permissions:

[ ] Add new employee

[X] View live dashboard

[X] View employee pulse logs

[ ] Access payroll

[ ] Export financial reports

They save the new role, and it is now available to be assigned to any user.
